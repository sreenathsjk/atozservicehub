# AtoZ Service Hub — GitHub Pages

## IMPORTANT: How to Upload to GitHub

This website uses **self-contained HTML files** — CSS and JavaScript are embedded directly inside each HTML file. No separate CSS or JS files needed.

### Upload Steps:

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** (any name, e.g. `atozhub`)
2. **Upload files** — you must see these at the TOP LEVEL of your repo:
   ```
   index.html        ← MUST be at root
   pages/
     latest-jobs.html
     govt-schemes.html
     ... etc
   ```
3. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source: main branch → / (root) → Save**
4. Wait 60 seconds → site is live!

### Common Mistakes to AVOID:
- ❌ Do NOT upload a folder containing these files — upload the FILES directly
- ❌ Do NOT put index.html inside a subfolder
- ✅ index.html must be at the very root of your repository
